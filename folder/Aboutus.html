It tells the story of the Kahns, a Jewish family who run a small general store in the fictional village of Sundown, a coal patch in Butler County, Pennsylvania outside of Pittsburgh. The protagonist is Benny Kahn, age eight when the novel begins, and his coming-of-age is sketched against the backdrop of the events of Great Depression through World War II.Rachel Griffin was born in Biddeford, Maine and raised in Sanford, Maine. She attended Sanford High School, where she did theatre, and the University of Southern Maine.[2] She earned a master's degree in music education from New York University and worked as a music teacher at a public preschool in New York City before starting her YouTube channel.[3] As of 2023, she is pursuing a second master's degree in early childhood education.[4]
